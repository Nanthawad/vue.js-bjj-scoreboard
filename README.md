# Vue.JS BJJ Scoreboard

This is just a simple Vue.js based Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu scoreboard I made for a competition.

# Use it online

If you just want to use it, go to gcj.io/scoreboard and that's it. You don't even have to be online to used it once it's loaded.

### Development

If you wanna play with it, it's easy.

First, clone this repo.

Then, install the dependencies with:

```sh
$ npm install
```

To run the app use:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

To build for deployment, run:
```sh
$ npm run build
```

That's it :)
